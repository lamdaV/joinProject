# Description:
A repository for our CSSE 333 project. The goal of this project is to create a working prototype demonstration of a Tinder for Gamers. Not in the dating sense but as a social network for gamers to connect with other gamers with similar interest.

# Requirements:
  - Node.js
  - http-server

# How to use:
1. Download the repository.
2. Navigate to the root of the repository folder.
3. Run `npm install` to update/retrieve required npm packages.
4. Run `npm install http-server --g` to install required test package.
4. Run `npm start` to build main.js. This will build the main.js upon any detected changes.
5. Run `http-server -p <port>' to start the server.
6. Open your prefered browser and go to `localhost:<port>`.
7. You should now see the generated HTML.
